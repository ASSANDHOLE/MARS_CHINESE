<h3>SYSCALL functions available in MARS</h3>
  <h3 style="color: #ff232b">Chinese Version is provided at the end of English Version, by Microsoft translate</h3>
</center>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A number of system services, mainly for input and output, are available for use by 
your MIPS program.  They are described in the table below.</p>
<p>MIPS register contents are not affected by a system call, except for result registers
as specified in the table below.</p>
<h3>How to use SYSCALL system services</h3>
Step 1. Load the service number in register $v0.<br>
Step 2. Load argument values, if any, in $a0, $a1, $a2, or $f12 as specified.<br>
Step 3. Issue the SYSCALL instruction.<br>
Step 4. Retrieve return values, if any, from result registers as specified.<br>
</p>
<strong>Example: display the value stored in $t0 on the console</strong><br>
<pre>
    li  $v0, 1           # service 1 is print integer
    add $a0, $t0, $zero  # load desired value into argument register $a0, using pseudo-op
    syscall
</pre>

<b>NOTES: Services numbered 30 and higher are not provided by SPIM</b>
<br><b>Service 8</b> - Follows semantics of UNIX 'fgets'.  For specified length n, string can be no longer than n-1. If less than that, adds newline to end.  In either case, then pads with null byte  If n = 1, input is ignored and null byte placed at buffer address. If n < 1, input is ignored and nothing is written to the buffer.
<br><b>Service 11</b> - Prints ASCII character corresponding to contents of low-order byte.
<br><b>Service 13</b> - MARS implements three flag values: 0 for read-only, 1 for write-only with create, and 9 for write-only with create and append.  It ignores mode.  The returned file descriptor will be negative if the operation failed.  The underlying file I/O
implementation uses <tt>java.io.FileInputStream.read()</tt> to read and <tt>java.io.FileOutputStream.write()</tt> to write.  MARS maintains file descriptors internally and allocates them starting with 3.  File descriptors 0, 1 and 2 are
always open for: reading from standard input, writing to standard output, and writing to standard error, respectively (new in release 4.3).
<br><b>Services 13,14,15</b> - In MARS 3.7, the result register was changed to $v0 for SPIM compatability.  It was previously $a0 as erroneously printed
in Appendix B of <i>Computer Organization and Design,</i>.
<br><b>Service 17</b> - If the MIPS program is run under control of the MARS graphical interface (GUI), the exit code in $a0 is ignored.
<br><b>Service 30</b> - System time comes from <tt>java.util.Date.getTime()</tt> as milliseconds since 1 January 1970.
<br><b>Services 31,33</b> - Simulate MIDI output through sound card.  Details below.
<br><b>Services 40-44</b> use underlying Java pseudorandom number generators provided by the <tt>java.util.Random</tt> class.  Each stream (identified
by $a0 contents) is modeled by a different <tt>Random</tt> object.  There are no default seed values, so use the Set Seed service (40) if 
replicated random sequences are desired.

<h3>Example of File I/O</h3>
The sample MIPS program below will open a new file for writing, write text to it from a memory buffer, then close it.  The file will be created in the
directory in which MARS was run.

<h3>Using SYSCALL system services 31 and 33: MIDI output</h3>
These system services are unique to MARS, and provide a means of producing sound.  MIDI output is
simulated by your system sound card, and the simulation is provided by the <tt>javax.sound.midi</tt>
package.  
<p>Service 31 will generate the tone then immediately return.  Service 33 will generate the tone then
sleep for the tone's duration before returning.  Thus it essentially combines services 31 and 32.
<p>
This service requires four parameters as follows:

<table width="600" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td><h3>pitch ($a0)</h3>
        
      <li>Accepts a positive byte value (0-127) that denotes a pitch as it would 
        be represented in MIDI </li>
        
      <li>Each number is one semitone / half-step in the chromatic scale.</li>
        
      <li>0 represents a very low C and 127 represents a very high G (a standard 
        88 key piano begins at 9-A and ends at 108-C).</li>
      <li>If the parameter value is outside this range, it applies a default value 60 which is the same as middle C on a piano.</li>
        
      <li>From middle C, all other pitches in the octave are as follows:</li>
      
        
      <table width="450" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="2">
        <tr>
            <td>
        	 <li>61 = C# or Db</li>
        	 <li>62 = D</li>

			</td>
            <td>
        	 <li>65 = E# or F</li>

        	 <li>68 = G# or Ab</li>
			</td>
            <td>
			 <li>69 = A</li>

        	 <li>71 = B or Cb</li>
        	 <li>72 = B# or C</li>
			</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        
        
      <li>To produce these pitches in other octaves, add or subtract multiples 
        of 12.</li>
      <br>
      </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><h3>duration in milliseconds ($a1)</h3>
      <li>Accepts a positive integer value that is the length of the tone in milliseconds.</li>
      <li>If the parameter value is negative, it applies a default value of one second (1000 milliseconds).</li>
      <br>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><h3>instrument ($a2)</h3>
	  <li>Accepts a positive byte value (0-127) that denotes the General MIDI 
        &quot;patch&quot; used to play the tone.</li>
      <li>If the parameter is outside this range, it applies a default value 0 which is an <em>Acoustic Grand Piano</em>.</li>
      <li>General MIDI standardizes the number associated with each possible instrument 
        (often referred to as <em>program change</em> numbers), however it does 
        not determine how the tone will sound. This is determined by the synthesizer 
        that is producing the sound. Thus a<em> Tuba</em> (patch 58) on one computer 
        may sound different than that same patch on another computer.</li>
      <li>The 128 available patches are divided into instrument families of 8:</li>

      <li>Note that outside of Java, General MIDI usually refers to patches 1-128. 
        When referring to a list of General MIDI patches, 1 must be subtracted 
        to play the correct patch. For a full list of General MIDI instruments, 
        see <a href="http://www.midi.org/">
        www.midi.org/about-midi/gm/gm1sound.shtml</a>. 
        The General MIDI channel 10 percussion key map is not relevant to the

		<br>
      </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><h3>volume ($a3)</h3>
      <li>Accepts a positive byte value (0-127) where 127 is the loudest and 0 
        is silent. This value denotes MIDI velocity which refers to the initial 
        attack of the tone.</li>
      <li>If the parameter value is outside this range, it applies a default value 100.</li>
      <li>MIDI velocity measures how hard a <em>note on</em> (or <em>note off</em>) 
        message is played, perhaps on a MIDI controller like a keyboard. Most 
        MIDI synthesizers will translate this into volume on a logarithmic scale 
        in which the difference in amplitude decreases as the velocity value increases.</li>
      <li>Note that velocity value on more sophisticated synthesizers can also 
        affect the timbre of the tone (as most instruments sound different when 
        they are played louder or softer).</li>
      </td>

System service 31 was developed and documented by Otterbein student Tony Brock in July 2007.
